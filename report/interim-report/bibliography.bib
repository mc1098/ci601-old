  abstract = {A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that
    identifies an abstract or physical resource. This specification defines the generic URI syntax
    and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines
    and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines a
    grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common
    components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible
    identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is
    performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}.},

  abstract = {Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax. Over the
    years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been
    popular among many Internet specifications. The current specification documents ABNF. It
    balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. The differences
    between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence,
    and value ranges. This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for
    a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.
